# Multiples of 3 and 5
## [Problem 1](Problem 1) 
> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
>  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## My solution

> **The sum is 233168**

I wrote a simple javascript code which should do the job. It has not been optimized.

```
var max = 1000, sum = 0, found = [], check = [3,5], stepMax = [];
for(var i=0; i<check.length; i++) {
   for(var m=parseInt((max-1)/check[i]); m>0; m--) {
     var value = m*check[i];
     sum+=(found[value]!==1) ? value : 0;
     found[value]=1;
   };
};
console.log("The sum is "+sum);
```
